# Cooling fan is noisy

There is a wiki link how to decrease the sound portion: https://www.rx-888.com/web/guide/fan.html#fan-specifications.
I have not try to use oil for suppresion, in my case I have had new fan already, when it was published.

# Recommend
From personal experience, I highly recommend the Noctua NF-A4x10 5V, Premium Quiet Fan (3-Pin, 5V version). It’s not the cheapest option out there, but it’s significantly quieter and has been running for several months now without any issues.

I also added a metal fan guard (40x40 mm) on top for extra protection, and modified the cooling setup so that hot air is pushed from inside the black box to the outside. As some fellow ham operators have mentioned, this approach can help prevent dust from being pulled into the SDR, which is definitely a plus.


# Note
I’d really appreciate any materials, studies, or resources on how to reduce noise using 3D printed designs. I’ve seen some design attempts used in studio environments, but I’d love to explore this topic more scientifically.

So far, I’ve been recording WAV files of various noises and analyzing their frequencies. Based on that, I’ve been experimenting with 3D printed designs to try to suppress specific frequency ranges. However, I’m currently lacking some understanding—especially when it comes to simulating how sound interacts with 3D printed plastic materials.

Any guidance, tips, or resources would be very welcome, even if the topic has already been addressed in projects like the Noctua fan. Feel free to just create a GitHub issue for me if that’s easier.

Thanks a lot!
