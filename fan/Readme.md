# Cooling fan is noisy

There is a wiki link how to decrease the sound portion: https://www.rx-888.com/web/guide/fan.html#fan-specifications.
I have not try to use oil for suppresion, in my case I have had new fan already, when it was published.


(I have try to print some cover, to avoud damage by animals or kids)[https://www.printables.com/model/1040709-fan-cover-for-web888]

# Recommend
 I would recommend from personal experience to buy "Noctua NF-A4x10 5V, Premium Quiet Fan, 3-Pin, 5V Version".
 No really cheap, but much more silent, running several months without any issue.
 
I also glue on the top metalic Fan Guard  - Metal Grill / metal Cover 40x40. And change the cooling, so the hot air is comming from inside of blackbox to outside world.
As mention by other ham operator, it should help, that dust should not come inside sdr.


# Note
I would be glad to get some materials/ study / anything,  how to decrease sound noise using 3d print design. There are some desing which try to do that in studio.
But it would be really interested to do this with science.
So far I have try to record wav files from noise and identify frequncies, then I try to create design which try to supress those frequncies.
But I have missing some knowledge how to simulate the sound and 3d plastic interaction.
So any hint would be welcome from my side, even the topic has been solved with Noctua fan.
Just create me an issue in github.  Thx
